# Mission_Coordination_lab1

This repository contains the implementation of the **Mission Coordination Lab 1**, which focuses on developing and simulating collaborative missions for multi-UGV systems. The primary goal of the lab is to explore control approaches and collaborative mission execution for autonomous robotic systems using ROS.

## Features
- Implementation of collaborative multi-robot tasks in a simulated environment.
- Integration of UGV systems for mission coordination.
- Mission planning and execution using real-time control algorithms.

## Requirements
- **ROS (Robot Operating System)**: The project has been developed and tested in a ROS environment.
- **Python**: For scripting and running the simulation nodes.
- **Gazebo**: As the simulation platform for the multi-robot system.
